# FinDBMS React App (src)

This is the migrated source folder for your Vite-powered React financial dashboard. All main app files are now in `src/`.

## How to run

1. Open a terminal in `c:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\Desktop\repo\fin_dbms\src`
2. Run:

    npm install
    npm run dev

3. Open the local server URL shown in the terminal.

## Notes
- All your main app files (App.jsx, Debtors.jsx, Ledgers.jsx, etc.) are now in `src/`.
- The old root files are not used by Vite anymore.
- You can safely delete the old files from the root after confirming everything works.
